### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Health and Fitness
- **Mobile:** This app is developed for mobile but can work just as well on a desktop environment, but a mobile version will be easier to track each meal.
- **Story:** Analyzes users health information to calculate their basal metabolic rate and generate a calorie limited meal plan, geared towards the users fitness goals. The user can track their progress over time.
- **Market:** Anybody who is health conscious and wants to change their diet strategy, or for people who want inspiration for cooking their own meals.
- **Habit:** This app can be used often to track all meals, or it can be used mostly as a reference point for framing a generalized meal plan.
- **Scope:** First we start by generating customized meal plans with recipes, eventually users may be able to upload their own meals. Big potential for creating a large food database, or incorporating lite social media elements.
